# Hello friend, my name is Luke! ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer who loves to learn new things and I am constantly growing. Through logic and creativity, I like to tackle problems that are challenging. Languages I am currently working with and learning include Javascript, Ruby, Python, etc. Please take a chance to look at my growth journal to see the things I am currently working on or have done in the past or take a look at one of my repositories. :point_down:
